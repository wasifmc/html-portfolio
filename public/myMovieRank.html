<h1>Wasif's All Time Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>All the Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p>
    I grew up watching Harry Potter. They are very nostalgic.
</p>
<h3>Spider Man No Way Home</h3>
<p>One of the most emotional movie I've ever watched. Brilliant.
</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Franchise, Naruto, Marvel</h3>
<p>
    No. 3 goes to quite a few of the titles. Such as DB Super Broly, The Last: Naruto the movie, and Avengers Infinity War. They are action packed, emotional, and visually stunning.
